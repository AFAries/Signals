## What is a signal when talking about electronics and communications?
“In electronics and telecommunications, it refers to any time varying voltage, current, or electromagnetic wave that carries information.”
-[Signal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal)

### What and how exactly does that translate to in regard to modern digital content, in layman’s terms?
I think the best way to describe it is that signals are waves of energy which we utilize to connect and communicate with and between any digital device.

Examples of this can be:

1. The process of connecting your laptop to Wi-Fi
2.	Browsing the Internet
3.	Bluetooth
4.	Using your keys to lock or unlock your car from the distance
5.	AM/FM radio
6.	And so much more!

Signals are everywhere and they keep us connected. Our eyes cannot see them though we have tools to inspect them, like an [Oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope#:~:text=An%20oscilloscope%2C%20previously%20called%20an,usually%20as%20a%20calibrated%20two%2D).

From an Oscilloscope, this is one way that you will be able to view a Sinusoid or [Sine Wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sine_wave). Basically, this is how we view the basic parts of a signal.

There are some key parts to understand about Sine Waves and signals. I want to focus on a few main aspects when looking at Sine Waves. When viewing a Sine Wave, you can view it as one circle cut in half. In that picture above and following the red wave, at X=0 the wave is at 0 degrees, when it hits the top point of the "hill," it would be at 90 degrees and so on, it goes up to 360 degrees. When a wave goes 0 to 360, that is the completion of one cycle. Frequency is the number of cycles completed per second. Amplitude is basically how high the wave goes vertically.

Here is one link that helps allow you to play with the different aspects of a sine wave and more of it than I cover here: [MathIsFun](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/amplitude-period-frequency-phase-shift.html)

### Why is it useful knowing about the basics of signals?

Well, the world often is often run in sort of a lock and key style. To open the correct lock requires a specific key. This holds significance in technology. If you don’t have the right key then you won’t be able to open the right lock. Can you play a cartridge game in a console that only utilizes CDs? Nope. In signals, one key thing to recognize is knowing about modulation.

Modulation is "the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a separate signal called the modulation signal that typically contains information to be transmitted."-[Modulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation)

Signals like to mix and combine. How they do so varies. Two of the most common modulations are Amplitude Modulation and Frequency Modulation or AM and FM.
You can probably recognize these two just on a radio player. Theres a reason things sound distorted if you would try listening to an FM signal on AM settings and vice versa. It goes back to that lock and key idea.

Recognizing the difference between a FM or AM signal for example will tell you how a signal or device operates. Knowing the properties of a signal can also help you identify it too. This is required in a field of [Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography) for example. It can also help you understand how your digital devices work.

### Conclusion

Well that's a pretty fast crash course on some information about signals. The field is sort of like a black hole of knowledge with countless aspects to it. Signals are how we run our daily lives and understanding them can be both interesting and profitable. Hopefully this might pique your interest about signals and explore more about them in the digital realm.
